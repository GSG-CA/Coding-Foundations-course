# Mentoring vs Teaching

There is constant confusion between the concept of teaching and mentoring or the differences between the duties of both the teacher and the mentor

📍 during this workshop, we will go through the two concepts and the differences, **and we**, as mentors what are our roles and what will we do for you

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  ✧ TEACHING IS ABOUT KNOWLEDGE
The role of the teacher is to share their knowledge *through instruction and explanation*. In the traditional sense, teaching involves formal lessons on a subject, often including a detailed lesson plan and methods of assessment.

##  ✧ MENTORING IS ABOUT EXPERIENCE
Mentoring, on the other hand, is more informal and relational in nature. A *mentor acts as an advisor, sharing knowledge based on their lived experience.* mentors strive to help their mentees grow into peers.

A mentor usually gives their advice freely.
The key distinction between a mentor and any other form of teaching is that the information isn’t prepared beforehand and delivered in a structured format. This is because the mentee might set the agenda for the discussions. They have specific needs and will ask the questions.

> *The mentor dispenses advice freely in response to a specific need or question.*

## Web development Mentors! 

Development mentorship goes beyond teaching the basics of coding, but goes deeper into pragmatic thinking; building real projects that are specifically tailored to your career goals, aspirations, and interests; working on your development portfolio; practising, sharing, and communicating about your work.

### What Mentors will do for you! 

* Deliver the workshop and make sure you have the basics that you need 
* *When you’re stuck at any particular coding problem*, mentors can help you solve it;
* *If you’re stuck between two career paths or choices*, mentors can help you decide what best suits your personality, knowledge, or interests;

* *If you are very slow at achieving your goals*, mentors can help accelerate your learning.
* *If you need inspiration*, mentors can be a great source of new ideas, challenges, and motivation;
* *If you need to prepare for coding interviews*, mentors can guide you through a set of appropriate challenges and advise on strategies for tackling the most difficult questions.


> Therefore, the benefits of having a mentor can range from helping you understand certain coding problems to advancing in your career to passing interviews and finally getting your dream job.
