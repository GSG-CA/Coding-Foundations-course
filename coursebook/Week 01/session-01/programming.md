## What is a program?

> Programming is a way to “instruct the computer to perform various tasks”.

**Confusing**?

this basically means that you provide the computer a set of instructions that are written in a language that the computer can understand to do a task or to solve a problem.

You can think of it like a recipe that tells you how to make a peanut butter sandwich. In this model, you are the computer, making a sandwich is the task, and the recipe is the program that tells you how to execute the task.

## Activity:

Come up with a sequence of instructions to tell someone how to make a peanut butter sandwich. Don't leave any steps out, or put them in the wrong order.
Was that easy? Did you remember all the steps? Maybe you forgot to tell me to use a knife to spread the peanut butter. Now I've got peanut butter all over my hands! Of course, you say, a person wouldn't be that dumb. But a computer is that dumb. A computer will only do what you tell it to do. This might make programming frustrating at first, but it's relieving in a way: if you do everything right, you know exactly what the computer is going to do, because you told it.


Of course, computers don't understand recipes written on paper. Computers are machines, and at the most basic level, they are a collection of switches—where 1 represents "on" and 0 represents "off". Everything that a computer does is implemented in this most basic of all numbering systems—binary. If you really wanted to tell a computer what to do directly, you'd have to talk to it in binary, giving it coded sequences of 1s and 0s that tell it which instructions to execute. However, this is nearly impossible. In practice, we use a programming language.

## What is a programming language?

Computers understand instructions that are written in a specific syntactical form called a **programming language**. A programming language provides a way for a programmer to express a task so that it could be understood and executed by a computer. 

## Why should you learn Computer Programming?
* **Programming is fun**: Using Programming, you can create your own games, your personal blog/profile page, social networking, a search engine like Google!! *Won’t that be fun?*

* **The backbone of a Technology Company**: The backbones of today’s technology companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, and many others, are giant computer programs written by a collaboration of skilled programmers. 

* **Meet incredible community** : The IT community is active and helpful both online and offline. 

* **Pretty good salary**
