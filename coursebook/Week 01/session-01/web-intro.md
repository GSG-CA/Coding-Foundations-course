## First, What is the world wide web?

**Are the internet and the world wide web are the same things?**

**_The answer is: NO!_**

> While they are closely linked, they are very different systems.

The _internet_ is a huge network of computers all connected together. The _world wide web_ ('www' or 'web' for short) is a collection of webpages found on this network of computers. **_Your web browser uses the internet to access the web_**.

### What is the Internet?

The Internet is a **global network** of billions of computers and other electronic devices. With the Internet, it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and do much more.

You can do all of this by connecting a computer to the Internet, which is also called going online. When someone says a computer is online, it's just another way of saying it's connected to the Internet.

### What is the Web?

The World Wide Web--usually called the Web for short--is a collection of different websites you can access through the Internet. A website is made up of related text, images, and other resources. Websites can resemble other forms of media--like newspaper articles or television programs--or they can be interactive in a way that's unique to computers.

The purpose of a website can be almost anything: a news platform, an advertisement, an online library, a forum for sharing images, or an educational site like us!

Once you are connected to the Internet, you can access and view websites using a type of application called a **web browser**. _Just keep in mind that the web browser itself is not the Internet; it only displays websites that are stored on the Internet._<br>

In short, **web developers build and maintain websites.**

Web developers often work for **clients** who are trying to get their product or service onto the web. The work is typically very project focused and involves collaborating with a team that helps to coordinate the client's needs into the end product. The client could be a tech company, an organization, or a government. The work could involve front-end, back-end, or full-stack web development.

Web development could be a good profession for you if you like solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting with new technologies. Web developers are in high demand, generally have a good work/life balance, and command comfortable salaries. Google your specific location to get a better sense of your local web development job opportunities.

_Earlier, we mentioned that web development work could be in the front end, the back end, or the full stack. What exactly do these terms mean?_

- The **front end** is the stuff you see on the website in your browser, including the presentation of content and user interface elements like the navigation bar. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience.

- The **back end** refers to the guts of the application, which live on the server. The back end stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs. This process can become very complicated when a website has millions of users. Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby to work with data.

- **Full-stack** developers are comfortable working with both the front and back ends.

## ü§û Motivation

Learning to code is incredibly rewarding but can also be difficult and frustrating. The strongest assets you can have as a student are a desire to build, a problem-solving mind, and persistence in the face of setbacks.

The web development industry has a long history of successful developers with varying backgrounds, so people tend to care more about what you've actually **built** than how you got there.
