### ✤ What is the browser?

A browser is software that is used to access the internet. A browser lets you visit websites and do activities within them like login, view multimedia, link from one site to another, visit one page from another, print, send and receive email, among many other activities. The most common browser software titles on the market are: Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google's Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple's Safari, and Opera. Browser availability depends on the operating system your computer is using (for example: Microsoft Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, Mac OS, among others).


The only real prerequisite for a good web browser is that it’s up to date and in mainstream usage. **Chrome and Firefox** are favorites amongst web developers. Safari is alright if you’re running OS X, too. *We strongly suggest not creating websites with ~~Internet Explorer~~.*

### What does my browser do?

When you type a web page address such as www.allaboutcookies.org into your browser,that web page in its entirety is not actually stored on a server. In fact each web page that you request is individually created in response to your request.

You are actually calling up a list of requests to get content from various resource directories or servers on which the content for that page is stored. It is rather like a recipe for a cake - you have a shopping list of ingredients (requests for content) that when combined in the correct order bakes a cake (the web page).The page maybe made up from content from different sources.Images may come from one server, text content from another, scripts such as date scripts from another and ads from another. As soon as you move to another page, the page that you have just viewed disappears. This is the dynamic nature of websites.

### ✤ What is Text editor?

A text editor is by far the most used developer tool regardless of what type of developer you are. A good text editor can help you write better code with real-time code checking, syntax highlighting, and automatic formatting.

We recommend the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) text editor. It’s user friendly even for beginners, and is available for all major operating systems. It’s also infinitely configurable, which will become important as you identify repetitive tasks that you can automate.

### Extension will need during the course:
- Live Server
- GitLens
- Prettier – Code formatter
- Open on browser

### ✤ What is Github?
[GitHub](https://github.com/)  is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.

*There are more tools that you are going to need the more advanced of a web developer you become but these are enough to get you going with this course.*
