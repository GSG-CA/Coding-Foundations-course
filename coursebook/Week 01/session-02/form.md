# HTML Forms

## What is Form in HTML?!

HTML Forms are required to collect different kinds of user inputs, such as contact details like name, email address, phone numbers, or details like credit card information, etc.

Forms contain special elements called **controls** like inputbox, checkboxes, radio-buttons, submit buttons, etc. Users generally complete a form by modifying its controls _e.g._ entering text, selecting items, etc. and submitting this form to a web server for further processing.

> Here's a simple example of form:

```html
<form action="/action_page.js" method="POST">
    <input type="text" placeholder='your name'>
    <input type="password" placeholder='your password'>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

> The `<form></form>` tag is used to create an HTML form.
