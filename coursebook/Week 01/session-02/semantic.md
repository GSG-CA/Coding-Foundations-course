# Semantics

**"Semantic HTML"** refers to the idea that all your HTML markup should convey the underlying meaning of your content--not its appearance. There's a whole set of elements designed for the sole purpose of adding more meaning to the overall layout of a web page. They're called _"sectioning elements"_, and they look something like this:

</p>


Using these as an alternative to `<div>` elements is an important aspect of modern web development because it makes it:

- easier for search engines, screen readers, and other machines to identify the different parts of your website.
- also helps you as a developer keep your site organized, which, in turn, makes it easier to maintain.
