# What Is GitHub ?

> ✧ Give your code a home in the cloud

To be very crisp about what exactly is GitHub, **it is a file or code-sharing service to collaborate with different people.** 

GitHub is one of the world’s largest community of developers. It’s an intricate platform that fosters collaboration and communication between developers. GitHub has a number of useful features that enable development teams to work together on the same project and easily create new versions of software without disrupting the current versions, but it doesn’t stop there.

Once new additions to a program are complete, for example, they can easily be incorporated into existing programs. GitHub also makes it extremely simple to work together on strings of code to really dial in and perfect even the smallest parts of a program. With GitHub, you can collaborate and work on projects with others anywhere in the world.


## Make your contribution

GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say, for example, a software development team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.
