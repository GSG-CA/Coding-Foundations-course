# First Project!

This is your first project to hand in this course. you'll be divided into teams, every team with 4 member.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìç Project Tips:

- Follow the link of your project to check the design of your idea.
- The result should be the same as the design we handed to you.
- The project score will depend on:

  - Git/GitHub workflow
  - Using a good page layout.
  - Using semantic HTML
  - Responsive design
  - Your role as part of the team

- Don't hesitate to ask the mentors when you encounter a problem during work or if you have any questions or need advice

## üìç Planning Phase

At this phase, what you need to do is the following:

- Look at and understand the design of the project
- You and your teammates discuss the design and what you should do
- Divide the project among you - each person has a task to do to complete the project
- After agreeing on the division, move to the build phase

### üìç Build Phase #1

One of the team members has to create a new repository on the FC03 organizing, your repository should contain the following:

- README file with these three points :
  * WHO (team members).
  * WHY (describing the purpose).
  * WHAT (describing your site).
  * HOW (describing the journey to completion).

- Issues: 
  * an issue for every task 
     - issue name is the task name
    - add a little description to the issue to explain the task
  * assign the member who will do the task 
  * add label

###  üìç Build Phase #2
One of the team members has to clone the repository and with the team help, create the file structure *(don't forget to create a new branch for that task)*.

Push the files and open a pull request and wait for the approval from the LM and team members. after merging every member can clone the repo! 

---
 ## üìç Publishing
On completion, your site should be published via github pages. You may decide to publish early *(perhaps to check how it looks on mobile, tablet, etc)*.

Your README should also include a link to the live site (you can also add a direct link next to the description at the top of your repo, so that others can clearly find your live site).

---

## üìç Tips

- The merge will be blocked till the LM approve your pull request (please be patient and wait for LM review) 

- You may encounter merge conflicts when working together on the same files. Don't panic, discuss the conflicts with your team before reaching a resolution.


- If you decide to use and stick to a particular naming convention for your CSS classes before starting the project then that's awesome! At the very least, aim to organize your CSS rules so they grouped together well and use clear descriptive class names.


- You should consider installing the Prettier plugin (code format) in your editors to ensure your team code is consistent. An easy step by step guide can be found here: https://prettier.io/.
