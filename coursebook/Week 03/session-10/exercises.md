# Exercises

**Note:** you can use online editor to work on the following exercises. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) for example.

## Exercise 1

Write a JavaScript `for loop` that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

**_Sample Output:_**

```js
"0 is even"
"1 is odd"
"2 is even"
----------
----------
```


## Exercise 2

Write a JavaScript function to compute the product of all integers from 1 to a given positive integer.

**Note:** In mathematics, this is called the factorial of a number and it's denoted by `n!` where `n` is a positive integer.

```js
// Expected Outcomes:
function findProduct(int) {
  // some code
}

findProduct(3); // Returns: 6 = 1 * 2 * 3
findProduct(4); // Returns: 24
findProduct(5); // Return: 120
```

## Exercise 3 :

 Write a JavaScript program that reverses a string

 ***test***

 ```js
 reverseStr(“hello”) should return ->  "olleh"
 reverseSt('Code Academy | Fundamentals Course') should return -> "esruoC slatnemadnuF | ymedacA edoC"

 ```


## Exercise 4

**Note:** *This exercise illustrates how to use nested loops. So if there is no time to solve it, then it should be homework and discussed later.*

Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern, using a `nested for loop`.

**_Pattern:_**

```js
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```
