# Exercises

**Note:** you can use online editor to work on the following exercises. [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) for example.


## Exercise 1

Write a JavaScript function to compute the product of all integers from 1 to a given positive integer.

**Note:** In mathematics, this is called the factorial of a number and it's denoted by `n!` where `n` is a positive integer.

```js
// Expected Outcomes:
function findProduct(int) {
  // some code
}

findProduct(3); // Returns: 6 = 1 * 2 * 3
findProduct(4); // Returns: 24
findProduct(5); // Return: 120
```


## Exercise 2

**Note:** *This exercise illustrates how to use nested loops. So if there is no time to solve it, then it should be homework and discussed later.*

Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern, using a `nested for loop`.

**_Pattern:_**

```js
