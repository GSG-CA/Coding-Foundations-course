## exercise 2 (15 min)
[Shortest Word](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57cebe1dc6fdc20c57000ac9/javascript)

Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).

String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.

[Get the Middle Character](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56747fd5cb988479af000028)

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. 
If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.


## exercise 6 (15 min)

[Sum consecutives](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55eeddff3f64c954c2000059/javascript)

You are given a list/array which contains only integers (positive and negative). Your job is to sum only the numbers that are the same and consecutive. The result should be one list.

Extra credit if you solve it in one line. You can assume there is never an empty list/array and there will always be an integer.

Same meaning: 1 == 1

1 != -1


## exercise 7 (20 min)

[Human Readable Time](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52685f7382004e774f0001f7)

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

```HH``` = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99

```MM``` = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

```SS``` = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

You can find some examples in the test fixtures.
