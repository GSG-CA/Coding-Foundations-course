## What are JavaScript Objects?

_Objects_, in JavaScript, it’s the most important data-type, and forms the building block for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

> Simply **_JavaScript Object_** is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is called as a property.

>

- Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as object data-types.

```js
const human = {
  firstName: "Virat",
  lastName: "Kohli",
  age: 30,
  yearOfExperience: {
    marketing: 1,
    accounting: 2,
  },
  greeting: function () {
    return "Hello";
  },
};
```

## JavaScript Objects Syntax

An object can be created with curly brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.

To understand this rather abstract definition, let us look at an example of a JavaScript Object:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue",
};
```

In the above example **“firstName”, “lastName”, “age” , “eyeColor”** are all **“keys”** and **“John”, “Doe”, 50 and “blue”** are **values** of these keys respectively.

> Keys are converted to strings by JavaScript and we will touch more on that later when we get to accessing the keys values

## Object Properties

Each of the object keys is referred to as the **properties** of the object.
Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read-only.

### Accessing properties of an object

Object members(properties or methods) can be accessed using two different ways:

1. **Dot Notation**:

   ```javascript
   objectName.propertyKey; //person.age
   ```

For example:

```javascript
const school = {
  name: "Vivekanada School",
  location: "Delhi",
  established: 1995,
  20: 1000,
};

console.log(school.name); // Output: Vivekanada School
```

2. **Bracket Notation**

```javascript
objectName["property"]; // person["age"]
```

Or

```javascript
objectName[expression]; // const x= "age"; person[x]
```

Let's take the same example above but try to access the properties using the bracket notation.

```javascript
const city = "location";
let school = {
  name: "Vivekanada School",
  location: "Delhi",
  established: 1995,
  20: 1000,
};

console.log(school["name"]); // Output : Vivekanada School

console.log(school[city]); // Output: Delhi
```

By careful how to access JavaScript properites, Check lines below

```js
console.log(school[name]); // ReferenceError: name is not defined

console.log(school.'location') // SyntaxError: Unexpected string
```

> That's confusing to JS as it would expect name to be variable, So be aware at Bracket Notation, your **_key has to be a string_**.

**The main differences between the two methods are**:

Unlike the dot notation, the bracket keyword works with any string combination, including, but not limited to multi-word strings. Also if key is number we can't access value using dot notation.

For example:

```javascript
    // check school object above
    console.log(school.20); // Gives error
    console.log(school[20]); // Output: 1000

    somePerson.first name // invalid
    somePerson["first name"] // valid
```

Unlike the dot notation, the bracket notation can also contain names which are results of any expressions variables whose values are computed at run-time.

For instance :

```javascript
let key = "first name";
somePerson[key] = "Name Surname";
```

Similar operations are not possible while using the dot notation.

### Looping through an object properties

To iterate over all existing enumerable keys of an object, we may use the **for...in** construct.

**Syntax**

```javascript
for (variable in object) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

**Note**: The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for each key.

Let's take an example:

```javascript
const person = { fname: "John", lname: "Doe", age: 25 };

for (x in person) {
  console.log(x); // will log fname, lname, and age
}
```

### Adding and deleting properties

#### Adding New Properties

You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value.

Assume that the person object already exists - you can then give it new properties:

Example

```javascript
person.nationality = "English";

console.log(person); // log { fname: "John", lname: "Doe", age: 25, nationality: "English" }
```

#### Deleting Properties

To Delete a property of an object we can make use **_delete_** opreator.

Example

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Joe",
};

console.log(person.name); // Output : Name
delete person.name;

console.log(person.name); // Output : undefined
```

## JavaScript Object Methods

A method is a function associated with an object, or, simply put a method is a property of an object that is a function. Methods are defined the way normal functions are defined, except that they have to be assigned as the property of an object.

> Simply **_method_** is a function declared as JavaSript object property

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  id: 5566,
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; // don't worry about this keyword right now!
  },
};
```

You access an object method with the following syntax:

```javascript
objectName.methodName();
```

You will typically describe fullName() as a method of the person object, and fullName as a property.

The **fullName** property will execute (as a function) when it is **invoked** with ().

This example accesses the fullName() method of a person object:

Example

```javascript
name = person.fullName();
```

### Built-In Methods

There some built in methods that we can use with JavaScript objects and they can be really beneficial sometimes like:

- **Object.keys()**: creates an array containing the keys of an object.

Example

```javascript
// Initialize an object
const employees = {
  boss: "Michael",
  secretary: "Pam",
  sales: "Jim",
  accountant: "Oscar",
};

// Get the keys of the object
const keys = Object.keys(employees);

console.log(keys);
```

Output

```javascript=
["boss", "secretary", "sales", "accountant"];
```

- **Object.values**: creates an array containing the values of an object.

Example

```javascript
// Initialize an object
const session = {
  id: 1,
  time: `26-July-2018`,
  device: "mobile",
  browser: "Chrome",
};

// Get all values of the object
const values = Object.values(session);

console.log(values);
```

Output

```javascript
[1, "26-July-2018", "mobile", "Chrome"];
```

- **Object.hasOwnProperty**: returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property.

Example

```javascript
const object1 = new Object();
object1.property1 = 42;

console.log(object1.hasOwnProperty("property1"));
// expected output: true
```

> These are not the only built-in methods and arrays are going to be disscused in the next session so it's fine you don't need to know them very well now

## JavaScript Objects Are Mutable

Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:

```javascript
let x = person; // This will not create a copy of person.
```

The object **x** is not a copy of **person**. It is person. Both x and person are the same object.

Any changes to x will also change person, because x and person are the same object.

Example

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue",
};

let x = person;
x.age = 10; // This will change both x.age and person.age
```

> Objects mutability maybe an advanced topic but it's good to get an idea about it from now so it's okay if you don't fully understand it.

> When you want to copy an object try not to mutate it.
