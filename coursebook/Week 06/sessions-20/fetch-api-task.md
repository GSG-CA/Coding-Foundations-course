# Fetch API Task


Your task this week is to build an app that queries an API and uses the results to update the DOM. 

What you choose to build and how you choose to display the data is entirely up to you!


## Choosing your API

you're free to use any API you want, but check the documentation before you start and if a free API key available.


## Recommended APIs

Hereâ€™s a list of decent APIs to consider. You can choose to use other APIs if you prefer.
