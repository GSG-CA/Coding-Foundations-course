## âœ§ Github Rules and Tips

Your project will be hosted on GitHub, therefore you have to use GitHub in the best way,


### â‡’ Issues Rule: 

After agreeing to divide the project into tasks, each task is an issue.
Each issue must :

- [ ] Have a descriptive title 
- [ ] Description: 

    - [ ] What is the page âž› the purpose of the page
    - [ ] Page sections [what the page contain]
    - [ ] page UI
    
- [ ] Labels

### âœ¶ Steps you should follow when you will start working on an issue and create a pull request :


- Assign yourself in the issue you will work on it and add the label `in-progress`
- Create a new branch and be sure that it's **up to date with the main branch**

- Time Estimation ðŸ••
try and include a time estimating for every issue, even if you are not sure.
_There are 5 built-in time labels:_
> - **T1d**: 1 day
> - **T1h**: 1 hour
> - **T2h**: 2 hours
> - **T4h**: 4 hours (half-day)
> - **T25m**: 25min

 When completing issues please leave a comment with the time actually taken to complete the issue.

> Start Working 

- Write a descriptive commit to show what you did and add the issue number to every important commit.
- In the description, write what you did and what you change, and how we can test it.
- Request a review from the `lead mentor` and team members.
- Add the label `awaiting-review` and wait or start working on other things.


### âœ¶ When the team review the pull-request :

* Read and test the code, pull it to your local machine
* if you have any comments and there is sth you want it to change write it and change the label to `change-request`


### âœ¶  Merging Pull Requests

The one who opens the pull request is responsible for the final merge, but only after team lead and one of one teammate has reviewed, approved, and left a comment on the pull request to that effect
