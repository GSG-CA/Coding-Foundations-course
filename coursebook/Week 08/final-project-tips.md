# 🏳️ Final Projects

This is the beginning of the final projects.

For this project, you need to think of a problem to solve with your team! You have to query at least two APIs and use the results to update the DOM.

What you choose to build and how to display the data is entirely up to you!

## ♢ Planning Phase

The most important stage is the planning stage, which will be for 3 days! Therefore, we advise you to:

- Don't rush to write code or open a repository, wait and start organizing your thoughts

- Brainstorming | Deciding what you need to build for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Exploring APIs you are interested in working with.

- Considering your user journey.

- Draw the initial screens (wireframes)

- Agree on the Style guide ( **Branding** -> Colors, fonts, and pictures)

- Agree on the File structure.

<br>

> _Do not forget that your team and teamwork is the most important thing during every step of the work - the approval of the whole team on what is being planned is a point that should not be ignored!!_

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ❕ While choosing your APIs!

- [ ] Is the API free to use ?
- [ ] Is a free API key available ?
- [ ] Is good documentation available ?
- [ ] Is there a high enough rate limit ?

## ♢ Design Phase

This stage will start from the third day of planning, You have two days to convert the wireframes into a clear design (UI) on Figma, follow what you agreed on in the style guide documentation

> **The deadline : Wednesday at 05:00 pm**

## ♣︎ Requirements

- **Design** ➙ aim for a responsive, mobile-first design.

- Your app queries at least **two APIs** using the `fetch` method.

- Your app features some **dynamic content**.

- A clearly defined **user journey**, documented in your readme.

- **A well-considered architecture** for your app ➙ think back to the workshops from the beginning of this week. Try to modularize your code, or break it down into separate files. Document any key decisions about how you structure your code in your readme!

- **Code** ➙ break your JavaScript down into small functions with clear input and output; this will make it more readable.

- **Comments** ➙ write comments to guide the users and devs

## 📌 Keep in mind

There are some tips and rules you have to follow

- Your team and teamwork is the most important

- Pay attention to delivery times

- Your team is your first reference when you get stuck, the LM are there for you too!

- The planning and the documentation stage is just as important as writing good code

- Every one of the team should contribute in every phase, **you should work in everything**.

- Working on Github (issues, pull-req, readme, ...etc) is not easy as you think, read [Github rules and tips](./notes/github-tips.md)

- all the team, spend a good time writing down your README, read [Tips for good Documentation](./notes/readme-tips.md)

- Follow 20-20-20 rule!!
