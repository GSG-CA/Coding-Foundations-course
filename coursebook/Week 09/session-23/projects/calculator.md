# Calculator

## Introduction

In this project you'll be creating a pretty neat toy for your portfolio to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You're going to make an **on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.**

Important Note: Before you get started with this calculator project, we need to cover a word of warning. As you look into how to evaluate complex mathematical statements in JavaScript, **you will likely come across the tantalizing `eval()` function. However, this function can be very dangerous and should not ever be used!** You'll need to build your own functions to evaluate expressions as part of this calculator project.
