# Pomodoro Timer 🍅

## Introduction

A [Pomodoro timer](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/) is a simple application that keeps you focused and productive by scheduling work and break sessions consecutively. _Traditionally, you have 25-minute focus sessions followed by five-minute breaks and a longer 15-minute break after four consecutive focus sessions._

## Assignment

### The basic process of the timer is as follows:

- Start a 25-minute timer.
- Work until the timer rings.
- Take a short, five minutes break.
- Every four pomodoros, take a longer break (15 minutes).

- The timer name must be displayed. Either `“Work”` or `“Rest”` depending on the current timer.
- The timer countdown must be displayed. Either `“25:00” or “5:00”` depending on the current timer.
- A start/stop button must be displayed. "Start" when no timer is currently running and "Stop" when there is a timer running.
- A user can start the 25 minute timer. At the end of the 25 minute timer a 5 minute timer will automatically start.
- A user can stop any timer only when a timer is currently running.
- When the final timer finishes the user interface will reset back to the initial state with the timer name set to "Finished".
