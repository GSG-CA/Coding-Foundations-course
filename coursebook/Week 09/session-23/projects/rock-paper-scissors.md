# Rock, Paper, Scissors :fist: :v: :hand:

## Introduction

In this project you'll be creating a pretty neat toy for your portfolio to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You're going to build a **customizable game of [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.afiniti.com/corporate/rock-paper-scissors)** :fight: 


## Assignment

As a user you will be able to choose one of the **3 options**, then the computer will randomly pick one, and then the website will tell you who won.

- Create a function to get a random choice from the computer. Then update the computer's choice container with this value.

- the user will choose the value

- add some logic so that instead of just showing text, you show images.For example, when someone clicks the rock button, it will show a rock.

- maybe you can reveal the winner in a fun animated way :)
