# Twitter Clone 

## Introduction

In this project you'll be creating a pretty neat toy for your portfolio to flex your DOM manipulation skills. **You're going to build a basic Twitter Clone**. Don't worry we are not going to do any networking yet! All the tweets will be local to each user on the site.




## Assignment


1. Start off by making the files on your computer and opening them in your browser.
2. Create the basic design of your webpage. You should definitely use the [real twitter page](https://twitter.com) for inspiration, but try to come up with something unique and fun! Make sure you have:
   - A container, "newsfeed", div to hold of the tweets (this will start out as empty)
   - A form with 2 fields for the tweet itself, and the username. There should also be a submit button.
   - A header with the title and a nice logo image of your site :eyes:
   - Use a CSS stylesheet to make everything look pretty :dancer:
3. Now you need to add some functionality. Firstly, when the user submits the form, the tweet should be added to the "newsfeed"
   - The tweet displayed should contain the tweet itself, as well as the name of the user, and two buttons - like and retweet
   - You will need to create a new div, and then within that div, have more divs for the username, tweet content, and the buttons.
   - Its a very good idea to create separate functions here:
     - Make a 'createTweet' function which will take tweet text and the author, and then return a the whole div of the tweet, with the buttons and everything. Don't worry about what the buttons will do though, just make sure they are there.
     - Then you should use an `onClick` _event listener_ on your button. When the button is clicked, you should grab the content of the input boxs and then just call your `createTweet` function to make the HTML :tada:
     - you will need to then add this HTML to the newsfeed
     - Don't forget to give everything classes and styles!
   - Try to make sure that each new tweet gets added to the top of the news feed...
   - "OMG, Why isn't my grid being created???"
     1. Open your browser's developer tools
     2. Check if there are any errors in the JavaScript console
     3. Check your "elements" pane to see if the elements have actually shown up but are somehow hidden.
     4. Go willy-nilly and add `console.log` statements in your JavaScript to see if it's actually being loaded.
4. Well done! You've done all the basics now to add the final touches:
   - Make it so that when a user clicks on the "like" button, that tweet changes to a different colour
   - Make it so that when a user clicks on the "retweet" button, that tweet gets repeated at the top of the newsfeed :twins:
5. So far, we've just been adding our tweets directly to the HTML. This is great, however, in general it is a good idea to store the data on our page in our JavaScript. This is the idea of seperating out the "content" layer (i.e. the data of the tweets) from the "view" layer, i.e. how they look on the page. Lets see how we might do this.
   - Create an empty array in your javascript file, called something like 'tweets'.
   - When the user submits a new tweet, as well as adding it to the HTML, we want to add it here to the array.
   - We will do this by creating an object for each tweet. The object should have 2 fields - one for the author, and one for the tweet.
   - Add some code to your `onClick` function so that it will create a tweet object, and add that to the tweet array.
   - Great we are now storing the tweets in JavaScript. Try using `console.log` in the onclick function to make sure this is working, and that your tweets are there.
   - If we wanted to now, we could now easily send and store our tweet data :tada: (if you're feeling really smart, try investigating how local storage works :eyes:)
