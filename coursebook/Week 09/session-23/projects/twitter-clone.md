# Twitter Clone 

## Introduction

In this project you'll be creating a pretty neat toy for your portfolio to flex your DOM manipulation skills. **You're going to build a basic [Twitter Clone](https://twitter.com/home)**. Don't worry we are not going to do any networking yet! All the tweets will be local to each user on the site.




## Assignment

- Create the basic design of your webpage. You should definitely use the real twitter page for inspiration, but try to come up with something unique and fun!

- create a function to post tweets that will have 250 characters limit.

- You can also retweet and like the tweets. But since we are not using any server and database, so nothing will persist. As soon as you will reload the page, everything will be lost.
